# Product Description & Purpose

Easily pull in and update your location information with the Olo Restaurant Connector!

Olo, the leading food ordering platform for the restaurant industry, powers digital ordering and delivery programs that connect restaurant brands to the on-demand world, allowing millions of consumers to order ahead or get meals delivered from restaurants they love. Olo’s platform enables every stage of restaurant ecommerce, from fully-branded consumer interfaces to the back-of-house order management features that keep restaurants running smoothly. 

Now you can keep your location data up to date as well with the Olo Restaurant Connector! Use this data connector to sync information such as your location phone numbers, addresses, and delivery and pickup information from Olo to the Yext Knowledge Graph. This connector will also help you ensure that any new or closed vendor locations in Olo are properly reflected on the Yext platform. With the Olo Restaurant Connector (especially if paired with the Olo Menu Syncing app), you will not need to worry about discrepancies between your Olo account and your Knowledge Graph-powered Yext products!
